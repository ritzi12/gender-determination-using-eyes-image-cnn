# GENDER DETERMINATION USING MORPHOMETRY OF EYES 

 This challenge is part of Deep Learning Bootcamp. You will have to build a deep learning model that would determines gender by Morphometry of eyes.
 
 
 ## BACKGROUND
 
 Morphometrics or morphometry refers to the quantitative analysis of form, a concept that encompasses size and shape. The morphometric analysis of images, which comprises measuring and counting, is used in pathology to obtain accurate data of cellular and tissue components thus, helping in better diagnosis.
The anthropometric analysis of the human face is an essential study for performing craniofacial plastic and reconstructive surgeries. Facial anthropometrics are affected by various factors such as age, gender, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, environment, and region.  

Plastic surgeons who undertake the repair and reconstruction of facial deformities find the anatomical dimensions of the facial structures useful for their surgeries. These dimensions are a result of the Physical or Facial appearance of an individual. Along with factors like culture, personality, ethnic background, age; eye appearance and symmetry contributes majorly to the facial appearance or aesthetics. 
 
Our objective is to build a model to scan the image of an eye of a patient and find if the gender of the patient is male or female.
