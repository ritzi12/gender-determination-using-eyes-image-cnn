# GENDER DETERMINATION USING MORPHOMETRY OF EYES 

 This challenge is part of Deep Learning Bootcamp. You will have to build a deep learning model that would determines gender by Morphometry of eyes.
 
 
 ## BACKGROUND
 
 Morphometrics or morphometry refers to the quantitative analysis of form, a concept that encompasses size and shape. The morphometric analysis of images, which comprises measuring and counting, is used in pathology to obtain accurate data of cellular and tissue components thus, helping in better diagnosis.
